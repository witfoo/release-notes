# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-030313

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Apache Cassandra log ingestion, expanding WitFoo's log format coverage. The Cassandra parser was created in response to previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments, ensuring these signals are now captured and available for security analysis.

## What's New

### Features

- **Cassandra Log Parser** — Added a new parser for Apache Cassandra database logs, enabling ingestion and processing of previously unclassified log messages observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (initial classification; enables capture and triage of Cassandra log events)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Automatically generated via the empathetic parser pipeline to reduce blind spots in log coverage.
