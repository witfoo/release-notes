# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.23-201903

**Release Date:** 2026-02-23

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for previously unrecognized Tenable log messages observed in customer environments. The `tenablestarbuck` parser ensures that generic log data arriving via UDP is captured and classified rather than silently dropped, improving log ingestion coverage for organizations running Tenable products.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `tenablestarbuck`** — Added an auto-generated empathetic parser to handle unknown Tenable log messages detected in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (catch-all for unclassified Tenable messages)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Ensures previously unrecognized Tenable log traffic is ingested and available for triage, rather than being discarded at the parsing layer.
