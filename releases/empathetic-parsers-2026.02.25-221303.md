# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.25-221303

**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, **starbuck**, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests generic log data via UDP and classifies unknown message types, expanding WitFoo's coverage for unstructured log sources. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `starbuck`** — Auto-generated parser for unknown log messages observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Enables ingestion and normalization of previously unclassified log data arriving over UDP, ensuring these signals are captured in the processing pipeline rather than silently dropped.

## Quality Assurance
### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |
|---|---|
| Compilation | ✅ Passed |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Passed |
| Lint | ✅ Passed |
| Fingerprint Uniqueness | ✅ Passed |
| Parser Registration | ✅ Passed |
| System Tests (Integration) | Not available |

### Test Coverage Summary
The `starbuck` parser passed all automated quality gates in the CI pipeline, confirming correct compilation, adherence to coding standards, unique regex fingerprinting (no collisions with the existing 249+ parser library), and proper registration in the parser catalog. Integration and end-to-end UI tests were not executed for this release.
