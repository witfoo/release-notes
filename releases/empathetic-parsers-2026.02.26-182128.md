# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-182128

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Docker syslog (`dockersyslog`) to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests via UDP and classifies messages under the `GenericLog` stream, ensuring that Docker-originated syslog traffic is captured and available for downstream security signal processing rather than being silently dropped.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `dockersyslog`** — Added a new parser to handle Docker syslog messages observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream Name:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - This parser ensures that previously unclassified Docker syslog traffic is ingested into the pipeline, improving log coverage and reducing blind spots in environments running containerized workloads.
  - All quality gates passed: compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and parser registration.

## Quality Assurance

### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |
|---|---|
| Compilation | ✅ Passed |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Passed |
| Lint | ✅ Passed |
| Fingerprint Uniqueness | ✅ Passed |
| Parser Registration | ✅ Passed |
| System Tests (Integration) | Not available |
| E2E Tests (Playwright UI) | Not available |

### Test Coverage Summary

The `dockersyslog` parser passed all automated quality gates in the CI pipeline, including compilation validation, unit test execution, linting checks, fingerprint uniqueness verification (ensuring no collisions with the existing 249+ parsers), and successful registration in the parser catalog. Integration and end-to-end UI tests were not executed for this release.
