# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.23-121703

**Release Date:** 2026-02-23

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, `sshdrfc`, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests via UDP, processes generic log streams, and classifies output as audit log messages. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.
