# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.24-221406

**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, **starbuck**, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests via UDP and classifies unknown log formats under the GenericLog stream, expanding WitFoo's coverage for unstructured log data arriving from diverse sources.

## What's New

  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Provides initial capture and normalization for previously unhandled log formats, ensuring no customer log data is silently dropped.
