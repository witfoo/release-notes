# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.24-102302

**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for previously unrecognized Tenable log messages observed in customer environments. The `tenablestarbuck` parser ensures that Tenable log data arriving via UDP is properly ingested and classified, reducing unknown signal noise in security operations workflows.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `tenablestarbuck`** — Added a new parser to handle previously unclassified Tenable log messages detected in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (empathetic catch-all for unrecognized Tenable formats)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Ensures UDP-delivered Tenable logs are captured and routed through the parsing pipeline rather than being silently dropped or left unprocessed.
