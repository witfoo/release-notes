# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-082005

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, `witfoostreamer`, designed to capture and classify previously unknown log messages detected in customer environments. This addition expands WitFoo's log format coverage by providing a UDP-based ingestion path for generic log streams that did not match existing parser fingerprints, ensuring no customer telemetry is silently dropped.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `witfoostreamer`** — Auto-generated empathetic parser for handling unrecognized log formats observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream Name:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Provides a catch-all ingestion pipeline for log messages that do not match any of the existing 249+ parser fingerprints, routing them through UDP for downstream triage and classification.
