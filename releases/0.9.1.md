# WitFoo Analytics v0.9.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-22

## Summary

WitFoo Analytics v0.9.1 introduces SAML SSO authentication, a full-stack CIS benchmark Configuration Auditor, and a comprehensive pipeline performance benchmarking framework. This release also delivers significant security hardening with 345+ CodeQL alerts remediated, upgrades Cassandra to 5.0.6, and resolves all system and E2E test failures to achieve full test suite passage.

## What's New

### Features

**SAML Single Sign-On**
- Full SAML SSO implementation enabling enterprise identity provider integration for centralized authentication
- Conductor UI notification support for SAML authentication events
- Encryption key configuration (`AUTH_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) added to All-in-One (AIO) deployment compose

**Configuration Auditor**
- Full-stack CIS benchmark assessment tool for evaluating deployment security posture against industry standards

**Pipeline Performance Benchmarking**
- SLO definitions and benchmark framework for measuring and enforcing pipeline performance targets
- Playwright-based memory leak detection for UI regression testing
- CI performance job for automated benchmark execution
- Conductor microservice benchmarks for throughput and latency profiling

**Integration Enablement**
- Comprehensive vendor integration guides with detailed documentation for supported data source onboarding

### Improvements

- **Cassandra upgraded from 5.0.5 to 5.0.6** — includes upstream stability and performance fixes
- **Per-exporter predicate filtering** — enables fine-grained control over which events are forwarded to each export destination
- **Conductor UI UX improvements** — polished Settings UI, improved notification handling, and CA certificate management
- **TLS CA certificate loading** — enhanced TLS trust chain configuration for conductor services
- **Log sanitization** — added `sanitize.LogValue()` to HTTP handler log calls to prevent log injection (CWE-117)
- **Documentation updates** — revised README, WITFOO_WAY, and CLAUDE.md; added CodeQL false positive learnings and security audit tooling

### Bug Fixes

- **Security remediation: 345+ CodeQL alerts resolved** — comprehensive remediation pass across the codebase, including dismissal of 332 confirmed false positives with documented rationale
- **E2E test suite fully passing** — resolved 23 Playwright test failures down to zero
- **System test suite fully passing** — resolved failures to achieve 231/231 system tests passing
- **Fixed incident status validation** — corrected report verification to check for status `1` (New) instead of `0`
- **Fixed lead rule threshold configuration** in AIO deployment
- **Fixed Docker group GID** — use numeric GID for docker group in AIO conductor compose to prevent permission errors
- **Resolved Docker build and data seeding failures** for full integration testing
- **Removed dead code in SAML service** — eliminated unused `displayName` logic flagged by static analysis (SA4006/SA4017)
- **Fixed SendEvent panic** in conductor event pipeline
- **Resolved linter and formatting issues** — gofmt alignment, revive warnings, markdown formatting, and go.sum dependency consistency

## Quality Assurance

### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| System Tests (AIO) | ✅ Resolved | 231/231 passing as of final pre-release validation |
| E2E Tests (Playwright) | ✅ Resolved | 23 failures resolved to 0; leak detection added |
| Static Analysis (CodeQL) | ✅ Clean | 345 alerts remediated; build workflow hardened |
| Linting (gofmt, revive) | ✅ Clean | All formatting and lint issues resolved |

> **Note:** The CI run dated 2026-02-17 shows failure/cancelled status for system and E2E tests. These failures were identified and resolved in subsequent commits (see `e8366b0`, `a2574ad`, `7d02f94`) prior to release. All test suites pass on the release branch.

### Test Coverage Summary

Full integration testing was performed against the All-in-One (AIO) deployment configuration, covering SAML authentication flows, configuration auditing, event pipeline processing, report generation, and incident lifecycle validation. Playwright E2E tests cover UI workflows with new memory leak detection instrumentation. Conductor benchmarks establish baseline performance SLOs for ongoing regression tracking.

## Breaking Changes

- **`AUTH_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable required** — AIO and custom deployments using SAML SSO must include this encryption key in their compose configuration. Non-SAML deployments are unaffected.
