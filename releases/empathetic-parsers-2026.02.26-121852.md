# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-121852

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, **starbuck**, designed to handle previously unclassified log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests generic log data via UDP and routes it through the standard serial pipeline for downstream signal processing. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `starbuck`** — Added an auto-generated parser to capture and process unknown log messages observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - This parser ensures that previously unrecognized log formats are ingested rather than silently dropped, improving visibility for security operations teams investigating novel or uncategorized log sources.

## Quality Assurance
### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |
|---|---|
| Compilation | ✅ Passed |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Passed |

### Test Coverage Summary
The `starbuck` parser passed all automated quality gates in the CI pipeline, confirming correct compilation, adherence to coding standards, unique regex fingerprinting (no collisions with the existing 249+ parser library), and proper registration within the parser catalog. Integration and end-to-end test suites were not executed for this release.
