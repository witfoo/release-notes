# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.27-181600

**Release Date:** 2026-02-27

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, **fluentdruby**, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests logs via UDP and classifies them under the GenericLog stream, expanding WitFoo's coverage to **250+ supported log format parsers**. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `fluentdruby`** — Added support for parsing log output from Fluentd Ruby-based logging pipelines.
  - **Stream Name:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (empathetic catch-all for unclassified log messages)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source` — ingests logs received over UDP transport
  - **Use Case:** Captures and normalizes previously unrecognized log formats observed in production customer environments, ensuring no log data is silently dropped from the processing pipeline.
