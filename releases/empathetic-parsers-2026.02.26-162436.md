# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-162436

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, **witfoostreamer**, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser supports audit log and unknown message types ingested via UDP, expanding WitFoo's coverage for generic log streams. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `witfoostreamer`** — Auto-generated empathetic parser that captures and classifies log messages previously going unrecognized in customer deployments.
  - **Stream Names:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** AuditLog, Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Enables structured processing of generic and audit log data arriving over UDP, ensuring these signals are no longer silently dropped or left unclassified.
