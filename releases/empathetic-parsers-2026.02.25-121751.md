# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.25-121751

**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for **Cato Networks** log sources, expanding WitFoo's parser library to support previously unrecognized log formats detected in customer environments. The parser ingests generic log messages via UDP and has passed all quality gates including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration checks.

## What's New

### Features

- **Cato Networks Parser (`catonetworks`)** — Added a new parser to handle log data from Cato Networks SASE/SD-WAN platforms.
  - **Stream Name:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** Unknown (empathetic catch-all for unclassified Cato Networks log messages)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Automatically generated in response to unrecognized log messages observed in production customer environments, ensuring these signals are captured rather than silently dropped.

## Quality Assurance

### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |

### Test Coverage Summary
