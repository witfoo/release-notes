# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.25-182803

**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for previously unrecognized Tenable log messages observed in customer environments. The `tenablestarbuck` parser ensures that these log events are now ingested and available for security signal processing rather than being silently dropped. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, and fingerprint uniqueness—passed successfully.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `tenablestarbuck`** — Added a new parser to handle previously unknown Tenable log messages detected in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (empathetic catch parser for unclassified Tenable events)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Ensures Tenable log data arriving over UDP is captured and normalized into the processing pipeline, improving visibility for SOC analysts investigating Tenable-sourced events.

## Quality Assurance
