# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.25-102454

**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Corelight Sensor log data, expanding WitFoo's coverage to 250+ supported log formats. The parser was created in response to previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments, ensuring these signals are now ingested and available for security analysis.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `corelightsensor`** — Added support for Corelight Sensor logs arriving via UDP source. This parser captures previously unknown log messages from Corelight network sensor appliances, routing them through the `GenericLog` stream for downstream processing and triage.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown (empathetic catch-all for unclassified Corelight messages)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - All quality gates passed: compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and parser registration

## Quality Assurance

### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |
|---|---|
| Compilation | ✅ Passed |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Passed |
| Lint | ✅ Passed |
| Fingerprint Uniqueness | ✅ Passed |
| Parser Registration | ✅ Passed |
| System Tests (Integration) | Not available |
| E2E Tests (Playwright UI) | Not available |

### Test Coverage Summary

The new `corelightsensor` parser passed all automated quality gates in the CI pipeline, including compilation validation, unit test execution, linting checks, fingerprint uniqueness verification (ensuring no regex collisions with existing parsers), and successful registration in the parser catalog. Integration and end-to-end UI tests were not executed for this release.
