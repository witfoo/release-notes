# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-044037

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, `witfooconfigloader`, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests generic log data via UDP and ensures that unknown log formats are captured rather than silently dropped, improving overall signal coverage for security operations teams.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `witfooconfigloader`** — Added an auto-generated empathetic parser to capture and classify unknown log messages observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - This parser ensures that log data arriving via UDP that does not match any existing fingerprint is still ingested, stored, and available for triage, reducing blind spots in log collection pipelines.

## Quality Assurance
