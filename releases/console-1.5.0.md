# WitFoo Console v1.5.0

**Release Date:** 2026-02-22

## Summary

Console 1.5.0 adds disconnected network support with self-hosted fonts, introduces CI quality gates with race detection and security scanning, and includes multiple rounds of dependency updates for improved stability.

## New Features

### Disconnected Network Support (PR137)
- Self-hosted IBM Plex fonts eliminate CDN dependency for air-gapped deployments
- Local `@font-face` declarations override Carbon Design System CDN references
- `font-display: swap` for all font faces ensures text remains visible during load
- Postinstall script copies font assets from `node_modules` to `static/`

### CI Quality Gates
- Race detection (`go test -race`) added to CI pipeline
- Security scanning (gosec, govulncheck) integrated into build workflow
- Quality gates enforce lint, test, and security checks before Docker image push
- Release branch handling for automated version tagging
- Slack notifications for build status via slackapi/slack-github-action v2.1.1

## Improvements

### Dependency Updates
- npm major version upgrades for frontend packages
- Go dependencies updated across all modules
- golang.org/x/crypto and related security packages bumped to latest
- Pinned bun ORM to v1.2.11 (v1.2.16+ breaks migration API with unexported types)
- Removed local `replace` directive in favor of published common v1.4.1

### Code Quality
- General code quality improvements from static analysis findings
- Untracked generated playwright-report files cleaned from repository
- Release notes push authentication fixed with dedicated PAT
