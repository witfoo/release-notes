# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.24-062714

**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

## Summary

This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Apache Cassandra log ingestion, expanding WitFoo's log format coverage to support environments producing previously unrecognized Cassandra log messages. The parser was generated in response to unknown log messages detected in customer environments and has passed all quality gates.

## What's New

### Features

- **New Parser: `cassandra`** — Added a new parser for Apache Cassandra database logs, enabling ingestion and processing of previously unclassified log messages observed in customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** Unknown (initial classification; captures unrecognized Cassandra log formats for further signal enrichment)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Automatically generated via the empathetic parser pipeline to ensure rapid coverage of emerging log sources.
