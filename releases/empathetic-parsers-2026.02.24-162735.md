# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.24-162735

**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for **Traefik** reverse proxy and load balancer logs. The parser enables ingestion and processing of previously unrecognized Traefik log messages detected in customer environments, expanding WitFoo's log source coverage to support teams running Traefik in their infrastructure.

## What's New
### Features

  - **Stream Name:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** Unknown (initial baseline; classifies raw Traefik log lines for downstream enrichment)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - All quality gates passed: compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and parser registration validated.
