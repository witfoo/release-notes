# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.23-162440

**Release Date:** 2026-02-23

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Apache Cassandra logs, expanding WitFoo's log format coverage to support Cassandra audit and general log ingestion. The parser was generated in response to previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments, ensuring broader signal coverage for security operations teams relying on Cassandra-backed infrastructure.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: Cassandra** — Added a purpose-built parser for Apache Cassandra database logs, supporting the following capabilities:
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** AuditLog, Unknown
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source` — enables ingestion of Cassandra logs delivered over UDP
  - Provides structured parsing of Cassandra audit log events, improving visibility into database access and administrative operations
  - Includes a catch-all `Unknown` message type to ensure no Cassandra log lines are silently dropped, enabling iterative refinement of coverage

## Quality Assurance
### Test Results
