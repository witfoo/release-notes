# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.26-102240

**Release Date:** 2026-02-26

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, `sshdrfc`, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser ingests generic logs via UDP, classifying them as audit log events. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `sshdrfc`** — Added a new parser to process previously unknown log formats observed in production customer environments.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Type:** AuditLog
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Auto-generated via WitFoo's empathetic parser pipeline, which identifies and builds parsers for unrecognized log messages to reduce blind spots in security signal processing.
