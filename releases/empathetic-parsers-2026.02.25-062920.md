# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.25-062920

**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Corelight Starbuck log sources, expanding coverage for previously unrecognized log formats detected in customer environments. The parser ingests via UDP and classifies messages under the GenericLog stream, ensuring that unknown Corelight Starbuck events are captured rather than silently dropped.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `corelightstarbuck`** — Added an auto-generated parser to handle previously unknown log messages originating from Corelight Starbuck appliances. This parser listens on the `udp_source` entrypoint, routes events to the `GenericLog` stream, and classifies them with a message type of `Unknown` for downstream triage and enrichment by analysts. This ensures no signal loss for environments forwarding Corelight Starbuck logs to WitFoo.

## Quality Assurance
### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status |
|---|---|
| Compilation | ✅ Passed |
| Unit Tests | ✅ Passed |
| Lint | ✅ Passed |
