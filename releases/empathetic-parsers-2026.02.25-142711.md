**Release Date:** 2026-02-25

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser, `witfooprecinct`, designed to handle previously unrecognized log messages detected in customer environments. The parser supports generic log streams with classification for both unknown and audit log message types, expanding coverage for UDP-sourced log ingestion. All quality gates—including compilation, unit tests, lint, fingerprint uniqueness, and registration—passed successfully.
