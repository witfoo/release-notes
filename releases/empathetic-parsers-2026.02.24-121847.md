# WitFoo Parsers v2026.02.24-121847

**Release Date:** 2026-02-24

## Summary
This release introduces a new auto-generated parser for Apache Cassandra log messages. The parser was created in response to previously unrecognized log formats detected in customer environments, expanding WitFoo's coverage to handle Cassandra's generic log output ingested via UDP sources.

## What's New
### Features
- **New Parser: `cassandra`** — Added a parser for Apache Cassandra database log messages, enabling ingestion and normalization of previously unclassified log data.
  - **Stream:** GenericLog
  - **Message Types:** Unknown (initial classification; covers unstructured Cassandra log output)
  - **Entrypoint:** `udp_source`
  - Parser was auto-generated from real log samples observed in customer environments and subsequently validated through all quality gates.
